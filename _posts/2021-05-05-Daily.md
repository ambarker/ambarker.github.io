Worked on con gen manuscript/RDA most of the day. Still can't find good enviornmental data for FLP and CC. Need to contact Doug about CC, otherwise pull what I can from Iafrate et al (2019). St. Andrews Bay (half of FLP) is included in NEAA but missing most data. Found potentially useful estuary data mapper tool but it doesn't work on my computer, try installing on lab computer tomorrow to check it out. 


Also spent time trying to get re-organized with my various projects and cleaning up my to-do lists.
