Refiltered GH data using `filtlong` using more reads than previously used. Need to find sweet spot where there will be enough data to get a better assembly but not too much that `Flye` gets maxed out. Looked into open lab notebook concept to potentially start using with MGL. Searched unsuccessfuly for environmental data for RDA-- don't have data for Cape Canaveral area or FL Panhandle samples. Cape Canaveral samples are near water buoy station but doesn't record info needed. FL Panhandle samples are near but not in Apalachicola Bay, need to look into other options. 

I have been working on a different DNA extraction protocol that is more compatible with opentron robot. Current method using magbind kit will not work because the beads tend to clump and become difficult to work with. Trying to optimize protocol using ampure beads for extraction instead. Previous attempt worked but need to reduce the amount of ampure that was used-- binding capacity of ampure is high (something like 3-7 ug/ul?) so only a very small amount is needed. Took 50 ul ampure beads and put on a magnet to get out of solution. Did 80% etoh and then mgH2O wash and eluted in 1 mL PEG to create 1:20 dilution.
